# beads-presentation
Presentation for the paper `Audio source separation with magnitude priors: the BEADS model `

## Installation
Through conda:
> conda env create -f environment.yml


Then, you can run the jupyter console:

> jupyter console

Which will open a browser. The presentation is in the `presentation.ipynb` file. Source code for the model is in the `src/beads.py` file. Note this is not optimized for speed, rather for educational purposes. I should create some optimized version some time.

## Running the presentation

I am using the `RISE` framework.

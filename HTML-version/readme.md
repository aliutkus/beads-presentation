## HTML version

This is an offline HTML version.
The ipython notebook contains figures exports from the interactive one


the `start.sh` file launches the nbconvert utility.

To print to PDF, we need to apped `?print-pdf` to the url that opens in the browser, and then print it.
I cropped the stuff afterwards, after some manual editing of the html file
